# difference between c and c++
- c++ allows for oop
# difference between c++ and c#
 - c++ and c# are not related, c# is a competitor to java with garbage collection
# what is a callback
 - function that you can input as a parameter. 
    ```c++
        int add(int a,int b)
        {
            return a+b;
        };
        int sub(int a, int b)
        {
            return a-b;
        }

        int func( "sub or add")
    
    ```

# what is a template
- allows for ambiguous data type to be passed to a function

# difference between stack and heap
- stack elements deallocate when out of scope and allocated statically.
- heap is anything that was allocated dynamically.

# multithreading is a spooky monster
- shared heap
- different stacks for each thread

# game dev: question, say off the top of your head what you get from dot and cross product
- dot product gets: the angle between vectors
- cross products gets: the perpendicular vector from the plane of vectors

# bit shifting
- know how to mask and shift bits properly,for example. Say you need to find where the ones in a int are, learn how to bit shift and how to get that information in a usable way.

# understanding string stream and the derivative libraries. 
- understand how to use the insertion/ any of those things. 
# understand some of the c++ library stuff like the normal map, set, and maybe priority queue.
- it will allow for building stuff faster than needing to build your solutions from scratch more often then not

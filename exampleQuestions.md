# difference between c and c++
- c++ allows for oop
# difference between c++ and c#
 - c++ and c# are not related, c# is a competitor to java with garbage collection
# what is a callback
 - function that you can input as a parameter. 
    ```c++
        int add(int a,int b)
        {
            return a+b;
        };
        int sub(int a, int b)
        {
            return a-b;
        }

        int func( "sub or add")
    
    ```

# what is a template
    - allows for ambiguous data type to be passed to a function

# difference between stack and heap
    - stack elements deallocate when out of scope and allocated statically.
    - heap is anything that was allocated dynamically.

# multithreading is a spooky monster
    - shared heap
    - different stacks for each thread

# game dev: question, say off the top of your head what you get from dot and cross product
    - dot product gets: the angle between vectors
    - cross products gets: the perpendicular vector from the plane of vectors
